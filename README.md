# About Me  
In addition to teaching adjunct online courses, I work full-time at North Carolina Virtual Public School as the Director of Outreach and Support. I have taken both seated classes, and like you, online classes, so I understand the challenges and the rewards that come with online courses. I completed most of my coursework for my undergraduate and graduate degrees via online courses at East Carolina University.

I am a Florida native but now reside in Clayton. I miss Florida, but I do love the 4 seasons here in NC.

## My Interests  
* Genealogy
* Furniture Refinishing

## Websites I recommend:
1. [Ancestry] - Subscription-based, but extrememly informative when doing family research.
2. [Family Search] - A Latter-Day Saints site with loads of genealogy records.
3. [Heirloom Traditions] - THE best furniture and cabinet paint there is!
